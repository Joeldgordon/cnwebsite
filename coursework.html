        <h4 class = "Question">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
        <p class = "Answer">
            The purpose of IT in modern business has been becoming more and more vital to all businesses even before the covid pandemic. IT is important to businesses in many ways, the main use of IT in modern businesses is store and backup information to a safe and secure location. An example of this is when you go to Curry’s and purchase an item and once you’ve gotten to the till and finished paying the cashier will ask you if you would like for your receipt to emailed to you or printed out. By having the receipt emailed to you it will be stored online in your email account and can then be accessed anywhere whereas when given a paper receipt it can be either loss or damaged so if an item needs to be returned it may not be possible as that is a requirement by most businesses to see a receipt as proof of purchase also even if the electronic device used to access the receipt is damaged it can still be accessed from another device as it is stored on the internet and another reason IT is used is to reduce the amount of paper used for receipts which can save the company money on that particular supply and also benefit the environment. This is because all receipts have an order or transaction number which can be linked to the item you purchased and even specify how the payment was made and with modern IT it would make it almost impossible to lose that information.

        <h4 class = "Question">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h4>
        <p class="Answer">
            What do you need to make projects sucessful?
            When it comes to doing any form of software development whether it is a game or a website it is important to choose a design method to keep you on track during the creation process. The method that I would use is the <a href = "https://www.projectmanager.com/waterfall-methodology#:~:text=The%20waterfall%20model%20is%20a,created%20to%20accommodate%20those%20requirements.&text=However%2C%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cwaterfall%E2%80%9D,used%20in%20a%20software%20context." title = "waterfall">waterfall model</a> development methodology is a sequential design process which is often used in software development when a new project is being developed.  The sequential design process is where the development of the project is done in order to get it completed efficiently and properly. An example of the waterfall model design process are the requirements, which is the step where the project is laid out on a document consisting of what needs to be included.  The first step is where the discussions on what the project will look like takes place, the implementation process is where the first two steps requirements and design come together to actually create something solid and close to a final version of the software that is being created.  The second step is the verification process which is where the project is then validated and by that I mean the software is then reviewed and inspected to make sure that it meets the requirements and design that was to be developed, and the final step is the maintenance stage where the project is reviewed again but this time to make sure that there aren’t any errors and if there are they can then be rectified.

    <h4 class = "Question">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT to creat my website</h4>
    <div class="Answer">
       <p> When it comes to deciding what kind of website I want to make I will conceptualise what I want my website to do and then make a list of the requirements needed for it to work the way I want it to and then decide on the visual aspects. Alot the planning for the website took place on my <a href = "https://trello.com/b/vZ7FFVzu/joels-website" title = "Trello">Trello</a> board and this made brainstorming ideas such as what I want to be added to my website and what needed to be. Trello has one feature in particular which I found very helpful that was being able to label certain task with colours e.g. red, orange and green which I used to label certain tasks as "To do, doing and done". This IT system made the enitre website creation process easier in terms of staying organised and focusing on the aspects that were important and had to be done. The colour scheme of my website was label as orange because I didn't see it as being something that more important that the content that needed to be added to the webpages.

        <h4 class = "Question">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects(What causes digital projects to fail and why?)</h4>
        <p class="Answer">
            When it comes to digital projects there are many reasons that it can fail and some of the reasons for that can because something simply was overlooked or was not researched properly before commencing the project. An example of this is when it comes to digital projects it is important that during the creative process the project is constantly being saved and backed multiple times to different locations such as a online cloud service like google drive or to an external drive. This is in case the hardware being used suddenly fails and there's a physical back up on a hard drive or if the cloud save data is corrupted or vice versa the external drive being the hardware that breaks. Another thing that cause digital projects to fail is if the software being used to create the project has not been researched properly and late on in the design process it is discovered that the software that was being used has limitations such as missing features which makes it difficult to finish the project or just not possible.

    <h4 class = "Question"> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h4>
    <p class="Answer">
        When it comes to selecting the software  and IT systems that I need to use to create a project I decide what I need by first conceptualising what it is I want to make and what that will require. Then I do research on what software and IT systems will allow me to create what I want such as choosing the Unity Engine when making a side scroller  game because based on the research I’d done that software would work and has been used on other games that I researched. In terms of making a website I would use a Trello board before I began creating anything because trello is an extremely good system if you're trying to stay organised and stay on schedule. Especially since a lot of IT systems seen today are not done alone they are created by multiple people doing different tasks all working towards the same goal and with all of the amazing features that trello has you can actually assign individuals to specific tasks so in case something is done incorrectly, correctly or hasn't been done at all then there is always someone to refer to. This makes working independently easy as everyone knows what they have to do and the task assigned to them can also be commented on in case a change needs to be made and also to keep everyone involved informed even if they are not in the same location.

For example choosing the colour scheme for my website was in the list of “To-do” but once that was completed I moved it into the “Done” section of Trello and it’s simple things like that which makes it easier for to keep track of what needs to be done and what has been it makes the website building less daunting.

    <h4 class = "Question">1.7 Describe the legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h4>
    <p class="Answer">
        GDPR is a new law that was introduced to give the consumer more control over how there personal data is used. Such as advertisements that are tailored to things that you search on your computer or purchase from online retailers. This new law was introduced to because two of the biggest companies in the world Google and Facebook who were giving other companies access to their services which consist of their user data. This can impact digital projects because it means that looking for a specific audience to target your product at may take more time because user research is important to every product so that the developers can find out what people love and hate about it. This means that the best version of the project can be released and tailored overtime to better support the target audience. Without GDPR this would have taken less time as the target audiences data can just be used without permission or require the time of the audience to provide feedback.

        <h4 class = "Question">2.1 Review ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed in making your own website are you happy with the tools you used? e.g. visual studio and trello </h4>
        <p class="Answer">
            Visual studio is the IT that I used to create my website and it was easier to use than I thought which made the creation process quite enjoyable. I used visual code to make a text based game using python and seeing as the languages are very similar it was easier to grasp html and the visual studio is very good when it comes to predicting the next line of code or giving you a list of options to choose. Trello is great because I can just spend time brainstorming and writing down whatever comes to mind in regards to my website. Such as what I want to include on certain pages e.g. pictures and colour scheme this also includeds using the labeling system to add colour markers to tasks which are more important than others meaning content for the webpages would be highlighted red. So whenever I go onto to trello to view my board of what needs to be done certain tasks will stand out more than others and will be completed first.

    <h4 class = "Question">2.2 Describe what IT tools were appropriate. </h4>
    <p class="Answer">
        The IT tools that I chose when doing my project were visual code and Trello and I feel that they were very appropriate for what I wanted to accomplish. I found both IT tools easy to use and also very helpful especially when it came to creating the project and staying on track with all the requirements that I needed to meet for the project. For example a working game had to be done in visual code using python and I used a Trello board to keep track of what the game need to included and who to assign specific tasks to as it was a group project. With Trello I found that to be the most valuable IT tool because assigning names to tasks makes keeping track of everything easier and allows you to stay focused on your own tasks.

    <p class="Answer">
        Very happy with the website I created I accomplished more than I thought I would be able to in terms of adding content and structure. I wish I knew some java code so that I could add some animations to my website to make it look more professional. I like the website I designed as it was based on my personal preference and simplicity in terms of colours used and image content. If I could change anything about the website it would to be add a drop down menu to “coursework” button and have unit options available on the left side of the screen that scroll down the page as the user did for clicking rather than just having hyperlinks at the top of the page. i would have also liked to add my groups pyhton game project to my website just to make it feel more interactive and give someone a reason to comeback to it.

            I would’ve like to add more animations to the project to make it look more professional e.g. buttons becoming bigger when hovered overOn my website I chose black panther as the background character I would have liked to have some of the headers switch between English and language used in the film to make it feel more authentic. As I mention in the previous question I would have loved to add my groups python game project as it would be a great of showing what we learned throughout the codenation course in a such a short space of time. I also have other projects that I have completed prior to course in my own time which I would've loved to add and may just do later such as an game companion mobile application for a game called "Destiny" at the time I thought the application was terrible in terms of being user friendly so I thought I would make an attempt at redesigning the layout of the application which I found fun. Although I am happy with the website I created as someone who loves technology I always feel like it can be better than it already is.

            <p class="Answer">
                When making my website using CSS I had to make a lot of adjustments to code to make sure I achieved the layout and design of the content that I wanted. An example of this is that on my webpage I use borders around my text and when I first tried this the text could not be read clearly because the background image. So I ended the code so the text would be displayed on top of a black background so that was easier to see. I still wanted the image to be seen in the background so I used rgba to give the black background some transparency. Another thing that happened when creating the website is that I had to change the background image because the resolution it had made it look blurred when enlarged and I only found this out after viewing the website in my browser and later fixed this by finding an image with a higher resolution.

        <p class="Answer">
            After making my website and looking back at it could’ve been planned better. By this I mean I changed the colour scheme multiple times because I wanted it to fit with the background image I chose when I should’ve chosen an image and then worked around it. The website could have been done in teams like the python game but in retrospect it’s a good thing it was a solo project. This is because this website is supposed to be personal, as in the design meaning the images and colours used are a reflection of the person making it and everyone is different. There would have been a lot of disagreements and I feel not much would have been accomplished. But if it was from a business standpoint divide and conquer is always the best way to get a quality end product and assistance is always nice.

         <h4 class = "Question">3.2  Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>
         <p class="Answer">
            There are some ways that I can think of to improve productivity and efficiency  is to focus on the Trello board more as it is very useful and makes it easier to maintain focus on the end goal. Essentially adding task’s and organising them in “to-do, doing and done” it sounds tedious but if I was to create  a website again I would focus mainly on the Trello board before I even began the coding and set aside time for specific tasks. I would try to use all of Trello features more especially the labeling and commenting feature that it allows you to do. Commenting on tasks which were already added if I came up any additional ideas that I felt would to be added to project and labeling task red or green made it easier to spot tasks that needed to be done and ones that had already been completed.

        <h4 class = "Question">3.3  Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h4>
        <p class="Answer">
            Next time I create a website I would focus make sure that creating a Trello board is the first thing I do because as I’ve said previously it helps to keep focus on the end goal and what needs to be accomplished to get there. Depending on the type of website I make I would like to try working in a team because there’s no telling what a group of individuals can come of with when they work together. I learned that from the python game group project when using trello to assign certain tasks to individuals on the team because it made the work load feel lighter and meant that extra attention and effort could be put towards individual tasks making the work be completed to a higher standard. I would also learn more coding languages in visual studio as it is a very intuitive software as it oftens knows what you may be trying to do even if you don't and as a novice I found visual studio to be extremely helpful.

            <h4 class = "Question">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h4>
            <p class="Answer">
                When creating my code and constantly making changes to ensure that the end product is what I want it to be I constantly kept on reloading the page for my website after every change was made no matter how small it was. I did this when it came to choosing the colour scheme for my website to pick out which colours would mesh well with the background I chose. I also did when this when it came to adding borders to paragraphs on my website to ensure that they were the correct size and fit with colour scheme I chose to go with. When attempting to add a video from youtube to my website I made the mistake of thinking that by just adding the link to video to the code would make the video appear after checking the browser it just showed the link and that was not what I wanted I didn;t want the video to take the user off of website so I then decided to embed the video and it worked out the way I wanted it to. I also did this when it came to selecting a background for my website as the first image I used become blurry when it was enlarged and I was able to find one with a higher resolution so that the background could retain it's quality.

The next page was the coursework page which Will contain all of the coursework for Codenation. And the about me page will contain information about me like my hobbies and interests along with some pictures and youtube video/s such as the university that I graduated from and an image of one of my favourite shows/manga. The last page the contact me page will contain my email address in the centre of the page and a link to my LinkedIn profile.

                When it comes to providing an online service whether that is being an online retailer or an online news site there are laws which must be followed to protect the user and creator against any problems. These problems are things such as selling user information to other companies which can solicit unwanted communication with certain compainies or individuals. As for the creator this can inlcude bodies of work created by individuals being taken off of there instagram page or website and then used by someone else without permission. The consequences for not follwing these laws are that companies could face fines up to 17 million euros or 4% of the companies annual income.<a href = "https://www.core.co.uk/blog/blog/ramifications-failing-comply-with-gdpr#:~:text=Under%20GDPR%2C%20organisations%20who%20fail,under%20the%20Data%20Protection%20Act." title = "Reference">Reference for consequences of not follwing these laws</a> here are some examples of laws that need to be follwed done bellow for online businesses.

         <p class="Answer">
            In this day and age everyone uses websites as it is the digital age however not everyone will have the same experience when using them as we are all different. Some people may have disabilities such as poor vision which may make it difficult for them to navigate websites and a solution for this is that every browser whether it’s on a computer or mobile phone has an option that allows the user to zoom in on the page to make the website bigger and easier to read. Another disability would be that someone suffers from epilepsy so flashing images or bright vibrant lights can cause harm to user and the solution to this is that either the use of flashing lights and moving images are not used or they are slowed down but the most common practice is to add a warning to page before the user can access it informing them that there website contains flashing images and vibrant colours with an option to disable it or to visit another site.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to file formats for websites there are many things to be considered based on the type of website that is being made. When adding pictures to a website the main formats used are JPEG, PNG and GIF. JPEG which stands for Joint Photograhics Expert Group is the most used file type of the three stated above because the photographs saved in that format are capable of containing 16 million different colours meaning the picture can retain it's quality and the file size of the image can made smaller because of the level of flexible compression it allows. This means the JPEG images can be load on websites quicker than other image formats like PNG and GIF. If audio needs to be added to a website then the file format that would be used would be MP3 as that is the most popular format for audio files and MP4 format would be used for video files as it is commonly used on muiltiple platforms such as Youtube.
