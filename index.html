       <p class= "look">Hi, My name is Joel and I am 25 year olds currently taking the codenation web development course and I am loving every minute of it. This could be because it's a course I could take from home due to covid and I am kind of an introvert, well at least until I get comfortable because unitl then goodluck shutting me up. This course was recommended to me by my Job centre coach and I was a bit skeptical about it because I have purchased some online courses before but could never stay interested, however this codenation course has been fantastic I wish I did this instead of going Uni and it made me finally accept that zoom is ok and meeting new people isn't so bad also it's been a lot a fun I didn't feel like I was work at all and everything is easy to understand even though I'm learning some languages for the first time it didn't seem daunting at all. Jay is cool I guess and a great teacher XD shoutout to him.<a href= "aboutme.html">Click this to find out more about me</a>.</p>
