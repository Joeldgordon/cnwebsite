        <p>I studied at Kingston University and have Bsc in Game Design, you're probably thinking "why not go into game design?" The short answer is that
            I had trouble learning the coding languages C++ and C# and couldn't grasp until my year but by then I had enough(Insert tears). I probably 
            could have switched courses but at that point in time I was sure that this is what I wanted to do and I had to finish it. But whilst being
            at University I discovered other things that interested me, some even more than game design. One of the modules I chose to take during my final year was User Experience and I aced it. The module was essientally looking at applications you use and criticing them and then redesign the application you chose to critique because we all have that moment of I wish this worked like that instead. Whilst redesigning the application I discovered that although it was nearly as tedious as coding I loved every moment of it. I even decided to continue this after I graduated using Adobe XD and photoshop to see if I could redesign an application to give it a professional feel.

        <p>Another thing I discovered is Twitch.tv a platform were people live streamed games that they were playing and also were gaming announcements were made. Now during this time there was a game called "Destiny" by bungie which allowed me to makle some great friends some that live in the Uk and some in the USA. Now why am I doing this at uni? because my schedule was terrible i'd have a 9am lecture for 2 hours and then another at 2 in the afternoon and as this was during my first year I didn't really know where to start when it came to learning coding besides the lectures. This did however intrdouce to online technologies as I had I thought YouTube was the only platform that offered that service. Then I decided to try streaming and uploading clips to YouTube so I could experience what that was like because I just have to know how things work.

            At Uni there was also a business module which was compulsory we had to take it and there was group work. This is when I met some people at Uni that I would hang out with over the years or at least until I graduated. During the workshop for business one of my new friends was reading the manga for "Naruto Shippuden". At this point I knew it was an anime but I hadn't been keeping up with it all but I figured I have the messed up uni schedule now is the time to get into anime and that became a ritual of ours every thursday to read the latest chapter of Naruto took us less than 2 minutes to read just before the workshop began. It's a fond memory I have of uni.

        My hobbies are reading manga, watching anime, movies mostly sci-fi/comedy, playing games with friends, listening to music and occassionally updating a blog I titled "My Thoughts".Refering back to the User Experience course I took at uni, I am analytical about things that interest me and this is the approach I take when it comes to watching films.I'm not thinking whilst watching the film "Oh I could've done ths better" NO!. It's with admiration for how well thought out films are especially the character designs, personas and the special effects that are used I LOVE SPECIAL EFFECTS. In particular there's a film franchise called Pirates of the Carribean that has 5 films, I don't count the last film as I like continuity in films I love stories and last film seemed to have none of that. The 4th film barely passes the mark but only because it retains the personality of one of my all time favourite film characters "Captain Jack Sparrow" played by Jhonny Depp. The character is always changing, one minutes he's the traitor, then he's the savior, the he's the fool and then the smartest one in the room. The character has so many layers which tend to resonate with me especially the he's lazy but can do it if he tried and of course how unreasonable the character is about nonesense. I added a clip below to show exactly what I meant when I sad he's unreasonable and sometimes the fool.
